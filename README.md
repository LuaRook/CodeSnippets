# Open Source Contributions
https://github.com/LuaRook/ZoneDaemon
ZoneDaemon is a dependency created by EncodedVenom. After the library was abandoned, I forked it and made modifications to the library to improve performance, memory usage, and provide ease-of-use to developers.

https://github.com/LuaRook/Replica
Replica is a recreation of loleris's ReplicaService that removes the bloat and allows developers to use serverside listeners out of the box.
